# sum 3
Given a target sum find 3 numbers in an array that equal the target number.
The numbers in the array should allow only one solution.

## same as sum 2 but with 1 difference
if t = a + b + c
then t - c = a + b
means you are scanning two numbers against the third which is similar to the sum 2 problem
