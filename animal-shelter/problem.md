# Animal shelter
An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly 'first in, first out' basis. People must adopt either the first arrived of all animals at the shelter, or they con select whether they would prefer a dog or cat and receive the first arrived of that type. They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built in LinkedList data structure.
