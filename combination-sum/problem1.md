# Combination sum 1
Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where sums of the candidate numbers equal T. The same number from C may be chosen any number of times.

  - all numbers will be positive integers
  - elements in a combination must be in ascending order
  - the solution set must not contain duplicate combinations

set {2,3,6,7} and target 7 returns [7] and [2, 2, 3]
