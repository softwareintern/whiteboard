# Combination sum 2
Given an array of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where sums of the candidate numbers equal T. The same number from C may be chosen only once per combination.

  - all numbers will be positive integers
  - elements in a combination must be in ascending order
  - the solution must not contain duplicate combinations

array [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5] and target 8 returns [1,7] [1,2,5] [2,6] [1,1,6]
