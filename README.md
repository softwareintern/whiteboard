#Don't whiteboard me bro
A collection of common programming exercises written in some language.
I'm including as many solutions as me or Google can come up.
Hopefully, a brute force one and the most efficient one is on the list.
I'll try to include some ideation in the accompanying docs.

## How to do
  1. create a problem.md file with a clear statement of the problem
  2. create an idea.md file a solution, thoughts, or links
  3. write a test or way to debug the solution
  4. code the solution
