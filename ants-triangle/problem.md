# Ants on a triangle
There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and the speed being the same.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.
