# Blue-eyed island
a bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island asap. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color but, they do not know their own nor is anyone allowed to tell them.
